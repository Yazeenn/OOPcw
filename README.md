Task 1
The code is ran through the main class, using the main method, to change details about the race, i.e the distance, the number of lanes, and horse attributes, this is done in the main class, with simple tweaks to arguments when creating instances of the Horse and Race classes. as per my improvements, more than 3 lanes can be implemented and so more than 3 horses, as it is in its current state, there are only 3, but more can be added. There are no dependencies that i am aware of, everything seems to run well.

Task 2
This is run through the RaceGUI class, uusing the main method, the top left of the GUI is a slider for the race distance, there is also a button to add obstacles, however this has no function attached to it, the button is just there. then there are 3 panels for 3 horses, in my GUI the race is limited to 3 lanes and 3 horses, here you can enter names for the horses, choose the breed, coat colour and a symbol for each horse. then there is a start race button, which runs Race.startRace() with all the information about the race distance and the horses, there is no graphical representation of the Race itself, the race is shown in the terminal as the code is run. there is also a close button, which terminates the program. lastly there is a statistics panel, which displays the winning horse, its finishing time and average speed (m/s).
